## How to Use

To use SheinBot, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - If you don't have a Telegram bot, you can create one by talking to the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram. Follow these steps:
     - Open Telegram and search for "BotFather."
     - Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command.
     - BotFather will ask for a name for your bot. Choose a name for your SheinBot (e.g., "MySheinBot").
     - BotFather will then ask for a username for your bot. The username must end with "bot" (e.g., "MySheinBot_bot").
     - Once your bot is created, BotFather will provide you with a bot token. Save this token; you will need it later.

2. **Get the Shein API Key:**
   - To access the Shein API, you need an API key from the RapidAPI platform. Follow these steps:
     - Sign up or log in to your RapidAPI account.
     - Subscribe to the "Unofficial Shein" API to obtain the API key.
     - Save the API key for later use.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ghaiith/shein-telegram-bot.git
   cd shein-telegram-bot
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Configure the Bot:**
   - Open the `main.py` file and replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with the Telegram bot token obtained from BotFather.
   - Replace `YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY` with the Shein API key obtained from the RapidAPI platform.

6. **Run the Bot:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

7. **Interact with the Bot:**
   - Open Telegram and search for your bot's username (e.g., `@MySheinBot_bot`).
   - Start a chat with the bot and send it a product keyword to search for products on Shein.
   - The bot will provide you with product details, images, and available colors (if any).
